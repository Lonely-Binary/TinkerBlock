  NTC Thermistor - first reading, MicroPython         TK12 / /p/tk12

  Wiring. Count from the square pad on the TinkerBlock board, parts
  up, header at the bottom:

    GND    -> GND
    VCC    -> 3V3   (SIGNAL is a fraction of VCC)
    NC     -> nothing   (unconnected on the board)
    SIGNAL -> GPIO 34 on an ESP32, GPIO 4 on an ESP32-S3,
              GP26 on a Raspberry Pi Pico

  Thonny
    Run > Configure interpreter   MicroPython (ESP32) or
                                  MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)
    Save it to the board as main.py to run it on every power-up.
    Nothing to install: machine, sys and time are built in.
